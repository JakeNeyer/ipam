# IPAM User Guide

IPAM is an IP Address Management application for tracking environments, network blocks (CIDR ranges), and allocations (subnets) within those blocks. Use this guide to learn how to navigate the app and manage your IP resources.

Use the sidebar to move between **Dashboard**, **Environments**, and **Networks**. The **Dashboard** gives you an overview of utilization and how resources connect. **Environments** and **Networks** are where you create and manage environments, blocks, and allocations. Open the **command palette** (⌘K or Ctrl+K) from any page to search or jump to a resource. This User guide is available from **Settings → User guide**.
