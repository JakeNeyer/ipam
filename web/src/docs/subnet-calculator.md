# Subnet calculator

The Subnet calculator lets you explore IPv4 subnets without creating any IPAM resources.

- Enter a network address (e.g. `10.0.0.0`) and prefix length (e.g. `/24`) to see the subnet details.
- **Divide** any row to split it into two equal subnets (e.g. `/24` → two `/25` subnets).
- **Join** two adjacent halves back into a single subnet.

This tool is for planning and reference only — it does not create or modify IPAM resources.
