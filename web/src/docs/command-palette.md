# Command palette

kThe command palette is a quick way to search, navigate, and create resources from anywhere in the app. Open it with **⌘K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux). Close it with **Esc** or by clicking outside. It works on every page, so you can jump to a resource or start creating without using the sidebar.

## Global search

Type in the search box to find environments, network blocks, and allocations by name. Results appear above the static commands. Select an environment to open the Environments page showing only that environment; select a block or allocation to open the Networks page focused on that block. Search is especially useful when you have many resources and know the name of what you want.

## Page navigation

Use the list to jump to **Go to Dashboard**, **Go to Environments**, or **Go to Networks** without using the sidebar. This keeps navigation fast when you switch often between overview and detail views.

## Create actions

You can start creating directly from the palette without opening a page first:

- **Create environment** — Opens the Environments page with the create form open.
- **Create network block** — Opens the Networks page with the new block form open.
- **Create allocation** — Opens the Networks page with the new allocation form open.

Choosing a create action takes you to the right page with the form ready, so you can go from idea to new resource in a few keystrokes.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Use **↑** and **↓** to move the selection, and **Enter** to run the selected command or open the selected search result. The palette is fully keyboard-navigable so you can search and navigate without using the mouse.
