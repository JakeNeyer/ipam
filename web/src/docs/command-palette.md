# Command palette

The command palette is a quick way to search, navigate, and create resources. Open it with **⌘K** (Mac) or **Ctrl+K** (Windows/Linux). Close it with **Esc** or by clicking outside.

## Global search

Type in the search box to find environments, network blocks, and allocations by name. Results appear above the static commands. Select an environment to open the Environments page showing only that environment; select a block or allocation to open the Networks page focused on that block.

## Page navigation

Use the list to jump to **Go to Dashboard**, **Go to Environments**, or **Go to Networks** without using the sidebar.

## Create actions

You can start creating directly from the palette:

- **Create environment** — Opens the Environments page with the create form open.
- **Create network block** — Opens the Networks page with the new block form open.
- **Create allocation** — Opens the Networks page with the new allocation form open.

## Keyboard shortcuts

Use **↑** and **↓** to move the selection, and **Enter** to run the selected command or open the selected search result.
