# Reserved blocks

Reserved blocks are CIDR ranges set aside so they cannot be used for network blocks or allocations. Use them for future expansion, DMZ space, or any ranges you want to keep off-limits.

- **Add** a reserved range with a name, CIDR (e.g. `10.255.0.0/16`), and reason.
- **Edit / Delete** reserved blocks as plans change.
- Reserved ranges are visible on the Networks page and Dashboard resource graph.
- **Admin only** — only admin users can manage reserved blocks.
