# Environments

The Environments page lists all environments. Each environment can contain multiple network blocks.

## Viewing environments

The table shows each environment's name and ID. Click a row to expand it and see its network blocks, including CIDR, IP counts, and any allocations within each block. You can expand a block to see allocation details.

## Creating an environment

Click **Create environment** to add a new environment. You can optionally create an initial network block at the same time by providing a block name and CIDR. You can also create environments from the command palette (⌘K) by choosing "Create environment".

## Editing and deleting

Use the actions menu (⋮) on a row to **Edit** the environment name or **Delete** the environment. Deleting an environment removes it and all blocks that belong to it; blocks are not moved elsewhere.

## Opening a specific environment

If you search for an environment in the command palette (⌘K) and select it, the Environments page opens showing only that environment (with a link to return to "All environments").
