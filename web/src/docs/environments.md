- **View** — See all environments and expand any row to view its blocks and allocations.
- **Create** — Add an environment with a name and optionally an initial network block.
- **Edit / Delete** — Rename an environment or delete it (and its blocks) from the actions menu.
- **Quick access** — Search for an environment in the command palette (`⌘K` / `Ctrl+K`) to jump straight to it.
